A Brief Introduction
=======================

It is not often that I find myself thinking “man, I wish we had in R that cool python library!”. That is however the case with the dowhy library which “provides a unified interface for causal inference methods and automatically tests many assumptions, thus making inference accessible to non-experts”.

Luckily enough though, the awesome folks at Rstudio have written the reticulate package just for that sort of occasion: It “provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R”.

In this post I’ll set about exploring the dowhy library while never leaving my Rstudio IDE or even writing python code!
